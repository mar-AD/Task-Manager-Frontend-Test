# Task Manager Frontend

A React application for managing tasks with role-based access control.

## Demo Accounts

Accounts created during testing sometimes get deleted unexpectedly I'm not sure if it's a database reset or that was done by you â€” but I wanted to flag it here.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## Technologies Used
